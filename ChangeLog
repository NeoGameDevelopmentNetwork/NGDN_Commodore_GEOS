Added a new snapshot GeoDesk64 v1.065:
 => /usr/snapshots/geodesk64/latest

Bugs fixed:
* Fixed a stupid copy'n'paste bug in file
  properties that could cause a "File not found"
  error when saving the changes.
* Fixed some typos in error messages.

Updated MegaPatch source code and documentation:
 => /src/megapatch64_128/latest
 => /usr/sources/megapatch64_128/latest

Added a new snapshot for MegaPatch 64/128 V3.3r10:
 => /usr/snapshots/megapatch64_128/latest

Bugs fixed:
* Backported the TaskManager fix from GDOS64 when
  open a document and the application is missing.
  Note: If that happens the document will not be
  opened, but there will be no error dialog box:
  Since this bug was undiscovered since 1999 it is
  not worth spending time in an extra dialog box.

Updated GDOS64 source code and documentation:
 => /src/gdos64/current
 => /usr/sources/gdos64/latest

Changes:
* Improved compatibility for GeoDesk and copying
  or deleting native mode subdirectories after
  border block update.
  When copying subdirectories with ":GetNxtDirEntry"
  GEOS appends the border block to the end of the
  current directory and sets an internal flag that
  the border block is now active.
  When switching between the source and destination
  drive, this flag is reset and the border block
  is appended to the current directory again.
  This will cause ":GetNxtDirEntry" to return the
  files in the current border block again.
  When deleting subdirectories recursively this
  will also delete the files in the border block.

  current TaskManager menu when install a new drive
  using GD.CONFIG.

Updated Sun Aug 14 17:37:08 2022
--
Updated GDOS64 source code and documentation:
 => /src/gdos64/current
 => /usr/sources/gdos64/latest

Changes:
* Added experimental support for border block
  within native-mode sub-directories.
  On native-mode disk drives this will make it
  possible to have up to 8 files available in all
  sub-directories. This might be helpful if you
  have multiple directories containing geoWrite-
  documents: Add GeoWrite to the BorderBlock and
  GeoWrite will be listed in all sub-directories.
  Currently only a simple "Add/remove to/from the
  Borderblock" is available from the popup menu
  to add files to the borderblock. Better menu
  options may follow.
  To make this possible a lot of changes to the
  native-mode disk drivers had to be done.
  Therefore a lot of testing is needed.
* When converting a disk into a "non-GEOS" disk
  do not delete files from the borderblock but
  move them back into the root directory.
* When open disk properties do not automatically
  load the disk/file statistics since that will
  take a long time on native-mode disk drives.
* Allow switching partitions from the disk-
  properties window. Note: This has no effect to
  the drive window itself. It is just an easy
  way to check multiple partitions.

Bugs fixed:
* When open disk properties from a native-mode
  sub-directory, the drive window will not be
  updated properly (Wrong disk name/file list).
* Set max. files in the current window when
  using shortcuts.
  This caused some file operations to abort
  because the file count was 0.
* The GEOS routine "ChkDkGEOS" was directly
  testing the BAM in ":curDirHead" instead of
  using a vector in ":r5".
* When using "SetGEOSDisk" directly open the
  root directory on native-mode disk drives
  instead of returning an error.
* When converting a disk into a "non-GEOS" disk
  delete all GEOS data from the directory header.

Bugs fixed:
* Fixed a bug GeoDesk64 that caused file properties
  to print a warning message about renaming files.
* More disk driver fixes. A similar issue that caused
  problems on CMD RAMLink and GeoDOS64 when switching
  partitions did exist on other drivers also but did
  not cause any (known) issues.
  Anyway, the code has been fixed to avoid other
  problems in the future.
  The same code does also exist in GEOS/MegaPatch but
  since it does not have caused any issues here in the
  past few years it will not be fixed.


Updated GeoDesk64 source code and documentation:

Changes:

  This should speed up booting GEOS.
* Check for default address when searching for any

* Only check one character when testing the device
  connected to the serial bus, e.g. "R" = RAMLink.
* Do now load all RAMLink partitions for all
  GEOS RAMLink disk drives.
  This should speed up booting GEOS.
* Keep GD/GD.RBOOT/GD.FBOOT in sync and print the
  same boot messages.
* Set default year to 2022 during boot.
* Update GEOS kernal in DACC only once during boot.
  This should speed up booting GEOS.
* Updated some source code comments.
* Search for disk drivers during boot using a fast
  directory check. Load disk drivers using cached
  track/sector address.
  This should speed up booting GEOS.
* Reduce usage/calls of ":OpenDisk". this does check
  for a new disk and also will calculate the remaining
  free disk space. Noot needed during boot.
  This should speed up booting GEOS.
* Improved "loading disk drivers to RAM" by using
  cached track/sector address for the disk drivers.
  This should speed up booting GEOS.
* Improved loading GD.CONFIG modules by using cached
  track/sector address for the config modules.
  This should speed up booting GEOS.
* Updated INIT modules for GD.CONFIG.

Development:
* Removed RAM disk drivers from testing kernal ROM disk
  drivers (RAM devices do always use FAST mode).
* Initialize RAMLink disk driver when using ":EnterTurbo",
  ":NewDisk", ":OpenDisk" or ":OpenPartition".
* Removed some deprectaed code.

Updated GDOS64 source code and documentation:
 => /src/gdos64/current
 => /usr/sources/gdos64/latest

Changes:
* Do not load printer and mouse driver during
  boot and let GD.CONFIG install the selected
  drivers.
* Load the GDOS kernal with the installed GEOS
  disk driver. This change will require more
  testing but was another part to speed up
  booting into GDOS64.
  I have compared this release with r220630 and
  MegaPatch 3.3r10 with GeoDesk64 and GDOS64 is
  about 25% faster on a stock C64 system without
  any fastloader like JiffyDOS. And GDOS64 has
  to load much more features into RAM!
  It is still horrible slow without JiffyDOS or
  any kind of Turbo hardware, but in that case
  FBOOT can be used. You can also disable some
  features to speed up loading.
  When using a fastloader or Turbo hardware the
  improvements will not make a big difference.

Bugs fixed:
* When using FBOOT to fast boot from a GEOS
  RAM disk the reserved 320K DACC memory for
  GeoDesk will not be allocated again.
  Since this would also affect for example
  TopDesk with RAM-TopDesk enabled, the best
  thing we can do is to install the original
  kernal routine for EnterDeskTop and let FBOOT
  load the configured desktop again.

Updated Sun Jul 17 00:05:05 2022
--
Updated GDOS64 source code and documentation:
 => /src/gdos64/current
 => /usr/sources/gdos64/latest

Added more adjustments to speed up the GDOS64
boot process.
Booting GDOS64 will always be slower compared
to GEOS V2 but with this update the boot process
might be a little bit faster then before.

Note:
A lightweight 1541 fast boot disk might be
possible but can not be recommended.
If you want to fast boot GDOS64 without a boot
floppy using extra hardware like an Ultimate or
TC64 it is recommended to use the GD.FBOOT
utility and a saved GEOS/DACC image:

Create a RAMDisk on GEOS drive A: including
all system/boot files. Make sure to save the
configuration. When using an Ultimate or TC64
save the content of the REU/GeoRAM to disk.
Copy GD.FBOOT to the SD card on the Ultimate
or TC64 (rename it to GD.FBOOT.PRG).
To boot into GDOS64 launch/execute GD.FBOOT
from the SD card while content of the REU or
GEORAM has already been loaded.

Tested with TC64v2 and a 4Mb GeoRAM as GEOS
DACC and a 16Mb C=REU. System is ready after
5 seconds without using a real boot disk.

Changes:
* Some error messages have been corrected.
* Split GD.CONFIG modules into configuration
  and installation parts. This should make
  loading GDOS64 a little bit faster since
  no configuration menus will be loaded on
  GEOS bootup anymore (except for the drive
  configuration).

  even if the drive is not configured for GEOS.
  Can be used to switch the directory on other
  SD2IEC drives or the Vice/FS directory before
  sending files using the "Send to" menu.
  You can also check the drive status, query
  extended settings from an SD2IEC drive or
  list the directory of the drive using PETSCII
  or ASCII mode.
  To open the CBM utilities menu hold down the
  C= key and right click inside of a window.

  NOTE: Make sure that you have set an absolute
  path for REU/GeoRAM/RAMLink images in VICE
  when switching the directory on a Vice/FS
  file system or VICE will save the ram image
  to the directory you have changed into using
  the "Send command" menu!

Changes:
* Added support for converting GeoWrite documents
  when using "Send to...".
  Note: "Send to..." was created to work with the
  VICE emulator and sending files to a VICE/host
  file system. It has not been tested yet on real
  devices or printers and does not support converting
  files between different GEOS disk drives.
* Added infobox/progress bar when sending files.
* Updated GEODESK.mod file:
  Added buttons to install or remove all modules.
  Added extra button to switch status for the
  selected module.
* New version for GD.INI since some unused options
  got removed. After upgrade you have to configure
  GDOS64 again.

Bugs fixed:
* Reset current drive when save GeoDesk options.
  This caused windows to display the wrong files
  after options have been saved.

Known bugs:
* SendTo may add an extra CR between pages when
  converting GeoWrite documents to ASCII.
* Some missing translation in GDC.GeoHelp.

Updated Sat May 28 16:06:25 2022
--
New MegaAssembler source code V4.4 released.
 => /usr/sources/megaassembler/v4.4
 => /src/megaassembler

Changes:
* Added option to check for valid operands
  for pseudo opcodes. Example:
  The GDOS64 code included some unused pseudo
  opcodes that had invalid operands.
  With V4.4 this will cause an error if this
  option is enabled.
  This option is disabled by default since it
  needs more testing but is recommended to be
  enabled for development projects.

Bugs fixed:
* Operands for pseudo opcodes not tested for
  valid values (e.g. when used with a label and
  the label was not defined).
* When linking a non-GEOS file into a VLIR file,
  the file size was wrong after linking.
  This was because non-GEOS files do not have an
  info block but the linker did not take care
  about that.

Development:
* Need to rename symbol names in the assembler
  (src.MegaAss4) or the code could not be
  assembled using Version2 of MegaAssembler.

Updated GDOS64 source code and documentation:
 => /src/gdos64/current
 => /usr/sources/gdos64/latest

Changes:
* Added module support.
  Moved FileCVT and GeoPaint slide show to
  the new GEODESK.mod file.
  Both features are now disabled by default in
  GeoDesk, but can easily be installed/removed
  using GEODESK.mod.
  This will make the core GEODESK small and
  it will start faster for those who do not
  need these features.
  The help pages and the "Organize disk" menu
  might be other candidates for modules.
  New features might be added as optional
  modules too.

Bugs fixed:
* Removed some obsolete opcodes and added some
  more symbol tables for the GeoDesk sources.
  MegaAssembler caused some issue with these
  code issues, newer versions of MegaAssembler
  will handle these issues in a better way.

Development:
* Merged duplicate code for display GeoPaint
  images in GD.CONFIG, GeoDesk and the GeoPaint
  slide show module.

Bugs fixed:
* Creating a new document or open an existing
  document using GeoWrite may cause a crash
  when used with a CMD-RAMLink.
  The bug requires a specific cursor position
  in the current document (value in $94 >$80)
  before closing the document and create a
  new one from the GeoWrite create/open window.
  This is the same issue as fixed in a previous
  release when using the TaskManager to switch
  between different GeoWrite documents.

TopDesk or MP128 users do not need these patches.

Make sure to read the README before installation!
You need the PATCH-SYSTEM to apply these patches.

  geoPaint (gPp2.01) and geoPublish (gPup1.01).
  Some of these patches might be obsolete, but not
  for all systems. Apply these changes before any

 => /src/geowic64koala

The idea for this application is based on the
WiC64 Koala demo which will load up to 500 koala
images from WiC64.de in C64 BASIC mode.

The program is based on the lib.WiC64 GEOS library
and the slide show code was ported from the GDOS64
geoPaint slide show module. See documentation here:

  pause the slide show. Press RETURN to exit.
  Note: While loading the next geoPaint file
  the keyboard is not checked for shortcuts.
* Added color profile support when loading a
  new background image using GeoDesk.
  This is the same feature as in GD.CONFIG and
  will load a matching color profile for the
  selected background image.
  The name of color profile must match the
  name of the geoPaint image but the last four
  characters must be ".col".

geoWLoad64 v0.1 released.
Updated Mon Mar 28 16:14:19 2022
--
New geoWLoad V0.1 released.
 => /usr/releases/geowload64

Updated geoWLoad64 source code and documentation.
 => /src/geowload64
 => /usr/sources/geowload64

Changes:
* When downloading mutliple files to an SD2IEC
  directory you will get asked if a swap list
  should be created.
  The swap list will automatically be enabled.
  Note: If you download files from different
  type then all files will be added to the new
  swap list.

Updated documentation for geoWLoad64:
 => /src/geowload64

Changes:
* Added support for multiple downloads using links
  from the link list.
  This will download all files from the link list
  to either a disk or an SD2IEC directory.
  Existing files will not be replaced when using
  auto download feature: If the file does already
  exist a new name will be created.
  If the last file is named "swaplist.lst" then
  you will get asked if you want to enable it.
  Enable swaplist will be skipped if downloaded
  files had to be renamed to avoid replacing
  existing files. In this case the swaplist would
  not work.
* Display current target filename during download.
* Added disk info.
  Click on "i" next to diskname to see the current
  disk info like diskname and count of free blocks.
* Removed temporary date/time feature since this
  is now included in geoWiC64ntp.

New Project: WiC64-GEOS64-DEMO!
 => /usr/releases/wic64-geos64-demo
 => /usr/sources/wic64-geos64-demo
 => /src/wic64-geos64-demo

The goal of this project is to get in touch with the
programming of the WiC64. It should just demonstrate
that access to the hardware is possible using GEOS.

Although the program is called a "demo", it is
fully functional.

This program shows the current wifi the WiC64 is
connected to and offers the possibility to start the
WiC64 portal menu. Additionally the program allows
to select the turbo mode for a SuperCPU or a
TurboChameleon64 before opening the WiC64 portal menu.

Added a new snapshot GeoDesk64 v1.064:
 => /usr/snapshots/geodesk64/latest

Bugs fixed:
* Do not offer an "OK" button when enter a new
  filename. Using "RETURN" to exit GetString will
  add a NULL-byte when exit the dialogbox.
  The "OK" button will not.
  This also applies to the function "Copy files and
  directories" and "Rename AppLink" when files do
  already exist and you could enter a new file name.

Updated GDOS64 source code and documentation:
 => /src/gdos64/current
 => /usr/sources/gdos64

Changes:
* Added options to support loading color profiles
  for a random loaded background image.
  The name of the color profile must match the
  name of the image for the first 12 characters
  and requires the suffix ".col".
  Example: GD64.LOGO -> GD64.LOGO.col
  If no matching color profile is found the
  system will either search for GeoDesk.col or
  will always use the default system colors.
* Updated some english setup and menu messages.

Updated GDOS64 source code and documentation:
 => /src/gdos64/current
 => /usr/sources/gdos64

Added a new snapshot:
 => /usr/snapshots/gdos64/latest

Changes:
* Do not display "Select partition" dialog when
  install a new disk driver if there are no matching
  partitions for the select drive mode. This only
  applies to CMD drives (FD/HD/RL).
* Added option to set a disk ID when format a disk.
* Added compatibility warning option when format a
  disk on a CMD-FD that does not match the current
  drive mode (e.g. select HDN and drive is FD81).
  If "Load drivers into RAM" is enabled, that warning
  will be skipped and the drivers will be switched.
  The default setting for this option can be saved
  using the settings menu -> "Save options".
* Updated messages for compatibility warning when
  creating a new SD2IEC disk image (there is no
  GEOS.Editor anymore...)

Bugs fixed:
* Clear ":drvUpdFlag" after driver has been switched
  or additional windows may not be updated correct.
* Reset flag to load files from top of the directory
  after driver has been switched.
