### DESKTOP V2
This is the documentation for the reassembled source code for the GEOS DESKTOP V2.x

The source code was generated with the help of [dxa](https://www.floodgap.com/retrotech/xa/) and then converted to text files with the help of some LINUX bash scripts and to geoWrite with the help of GeoDOS64.

The developer source code currently compiles an exact 1:1 copy of "DESK TOP" using MegaAss V4.1.

There is no source code release yet, only the documentation. There is still some work to be done (replace absolute addresses with labels, convert byte tables to text...)
Once the code is fully restored, adding NativeMode support could be one of the further goals.
